# MATH4021 Advanced Dynamical Systems
### Semester 1, 2023 at The University of Western Australia

This repository contains various worked examples and computational exercises to assist students enroled in MATH4021.

Currently:
- ```DoublePendulumExample.ipynb``` : examples of embedding for continuous systems, first the four-dimensional double pendulum (which under gravity is asympototically stable, but nonetheless rather messy when trying to lok at it in three dimensions) (week3)
- ```ComputersCantDouble.ipynb``` :  demonstration that it is best to think before believing everything that computers can tell you about base-2 arithmetic (week 2)
- ``FalseNearestNeighbours.ipynb`` : naive implementation of false nearest neighbours - following exactly the description from class (week 4)    
- ``NonlinearModelling.ipynb`` : nonlinear radial basis modelling of time series via Takens' time delay embedding and minimum description length (weeks 5-6)
- ``Dimensions.ipynb`` : estimation of correlation integral and (subsequently) correlation dimension ala (G&P, Judd and GKA).              
- ``Surrogates.ipynb`` : surrogate hypothesis testing

Updating now for 2022.
