# MATH4021 Advanced Dynamical Systems
### Semester 1, 2021 at The University of Western Australia

This repository contains various worked examples and computational exercises to assist students enroled in MATH4021.

Currently:
- ```DoublePendulumExample.ipynb``` : examples of embedding for continuous systems, first the four-dimensional double pendulum (which under gravity is asympototically stable, but nonetheless rather messy when trying to lok at it in three dimensions) (week3)
- ```ComputersCantDouble.ipynb``` :  demonstration that it is best to think before believing everything that computers can tell you about base-2 arithmetic (week 2)


More to come.
